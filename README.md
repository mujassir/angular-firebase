
# What you'll build
In this project, we'll build a web kanban board with Angular and Firebase! Our final app will have three categories of tasks: backlog, in progress, and completed. We'll be able to create, delete tasks, and transfer them from one category to another using drag and drop.

We'll develop the user interface using Angular and use Firestore as our persistent store. At the end of the codelab we'll deploy the app to Firebase Hosting using the Angular CLI.
